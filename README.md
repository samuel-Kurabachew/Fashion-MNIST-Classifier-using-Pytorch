# Fashion-MNIST-Classifier-using-Pytorch

The dataset can be found here [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). Fashion-MNIST is a set of 28x28 greyscale images of clothes. It's more complex than MNIST, so it's a better representation of the actual performance of a network, and a better representation of datasets in the real world.
